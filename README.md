# call-me-bob 🤖

**To-Do List #04** — Bob has a to-do list. You have Python. Let's make a deal.

A cozy, game-like site to practice Python in the browser. Help Bob fix his
windmill, run the bake sale, tidy up his workshop and watch his sunflowers —
one chore at a time. No timers, no pressure: pick a chore, read Bob's note,
write your function and hit **Grade me!**. Bob's little robot helper checks
your code right in your browser and shows a full test trace.

## Features

- 📝 **7 chores** across 4 days of Bob's week, each with a story-driven subject
- 🐍 **Python editor** powered by CodeMirror 6 (syntax highlighting, indent guides)
- 🤖 **In-browser grading** — tests run locally via [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org)
  (WebAssembly CPython), nothing ever leaves your machine
- 🔍 **Full test trace** — every test case shows the call, expected value, your
  result and OK/KO, just like a terminal grader
- ⭐ **Progress tracking** — solved chores and your code are saved in
  `localStorage`
- 📱 **Responsive** — works on desktop and mobile
